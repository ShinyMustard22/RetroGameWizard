# RetroGameWizard

A chrome extention that allows users to play retro games in class, where they are less likely to get caught. Currently the extention only supports Pong and Breakout, but more games will continue to be added.

Additionally the service does not have a backend or any sort of state saving. This is another feature that may be added in the future.

## Installation

Instructions will be added once the extension is deployed...
